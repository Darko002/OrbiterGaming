Thank you for commissioning us to do a job for your server here are the items included in this pack:

-CSS weapons
-UU faction and Civilian Medical Aid Faction
-UU to be able to open combine doors
-CMA to spawn with medical uniform and radios
-A flag that grants free medical supplies.

=======================
Things to Note:
=======================

1. Due to the nature of RealCS it left a couple of weapons off of it for some reason. This includes the dual elites and the knife.

2. Factions spawn with suitcases as well (Will try and fix for a later date.)

3. The free medical supply flag is "M"

4. In the event the factions classes don't work, then just extract them from the plugin and put them in the normal files.

================
Bugs:
================

(Mentioned above)

1.Player models can look a little off while holding CSS weapons since the models were never made to hold the weapons.

2.RealCS ammo can include SMG, Pistol, crossbow bolts and AR2 rounds. It seems to be a case of trial and error as it isn't always obvious which is which.(Again something with the base RealCS rather than how the HL2RP weapons were coded)


================
How to install:
================
