Notes

We chose not to warn players who are getting S2M Mode enforced on them, because most of the times this command will be used on extreme situations (players not wanting to set up their S2M Mode on, rule breakers)

Therfore letting them know they are getting enforced something that can be freely disabled by them, is not a good choice.


Suggested usage of the plugin

We realized a good usage for this command would be that every player involved in a S2M firefight, would get into S2M Mode, to avoid accidents.

Instead setting the whole server to S2M Mode, can be used as emergency for bad situations, or for events that include a lot of shooting.
